# How to public

## S3 Bucket

To public our website, we wil be using AWS S3 Bucket service. To configure it, the steps are as follows:

### Step 1. Creating S3 Bucket

* Go to **S3** and click **Create bucket**.

* Select a region. I recommend the American ones because they are the cheapest, but decide for yourself based on your needs. 
* Give the bucket a name.

* Scroll down and uncheck **Block all public access**. So that we can host our public static website.

* Scroll to the bottom and press **Create bucket**.

### Step 2. Pre-settings for the static website

* In the list of buckets, select the created bucket and go to **Properties** tab.

* Scroll all the way down and find **Static website hosting** section. Click on **Edit**.

* Change the setting to **Enable**, enter the index document name and **Save changes**.

### Step 3. Adding a bucket policy

To make the objects in the bucket publicly readable, we must write a bucket policy that grants everyone `s3:GetObject` permission.

* Under **Properties** tab find **Bucket Policy**. Choose **Edit**

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simple-site/assets/49815002/b79fdf9e-49d5-4da0-9d7d-4cd9f4152ddd)

* To grant public read access for your website, copy the following bucket policy, and paste it in the **Bucket policy editor**.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::Bucket-Name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

5. Update the `Resource` to your bucket name. In the preceding example bucket policy, `Bucket-Name` is a placeholder for the bucket name. 
6. Choose **Save changes**. A message appears indicating that the bucket policy has been successfully added.

## Creating IAM User

Now what we need to do is to create a new **IAM** user. This user will give controll access to the S3 bucket. We need this user's credentials for our pipeline.

* Navigate to **IAM** and from the menu on the left, click on **Users**.
* Choose **Create User** to create a new user.

* Give your user a name.

* Click **Next**. Select **Attach policies directly**. From the provided list, select **AmazonS3FullAccess** (_this gives our suser full access to S3 bucket_).

* Go **Next**. There you can add a tag and review your user. Then hit **Create user**.

## Ð¡reating access key

* We need to create an access key to send programmatic calls to AWS. Select the user in the user list and proceed to **Security credentials tab** and click **Create access key**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simple-site/assets/49815002/68c75e79-cb2c-4a05-ae97-c5cce5e337ca)

* Select **Command Line Interface (CLI)**

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simple-site/assets/49815002/0f3e51fd-3c46-40c0-8b91-0634faa89a60)

* You can add a description to recognize your key later. After that hit **Create access key**. 

* Once the process is complete, you will be able to download your user credentials. **Remember to keep it private**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simple-site/assets/49815002/c51fab7a-33a7-4533-aaec-743baf0a89d4)

## Passing the credentials to github

Now that we have created the user, we need to use the credentials in our github account.

* In the github repository click on **Settings**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simple-site/assets/49815002/2ad4d0c3-6e0b-4d65-a1e3-6d71f58d4c9d)

* From the left hand menu, scroll down to **Security** and click on **Secrets and variables**, When the dropdown opens, select **Actions**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simple-site/assets/49815002/d47c94f7-83d9-4369-b2c6-87da1a642e1c)

* Now we are going to add our user credentials to this repository. Click on **New repository** secret and add your **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**. Repeat the action for **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simple-site/assets/49815002/d4ec7eda-e010-4879-8a07-4c26af4025f1)

We are doing this because it is best practice to not expose your security keys to the public. 

## Creating a Workflow

Next, we create a _workflow_ for the deployment.

* Select the **Actions** tab and click on **New workflow**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simple-site/assets/49815002/ef98e897-649b-4350-87bb-7ff0d36c15e9)

* Click on **set up workflow yourself**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simple-site/assets/49815002/6f7bfd68-d42f-4ccd-abdb-a5ade717e954)

* Next, insert this script into your workspace.

```yaml
name: Upload Website

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main

jobs:
  deploy-site:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@master
        with:
          args: --delete
        env:
          AWS_S3_BUCKET: YOUR BUCKET NAME
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          SOURCE_DIR: ./main
```

_This workflow says that once you push your code to the main branch the following tasks should take place one after the other:_

1. _GitHub Actions will search for the credentials you stored in secrets and use that to access your S3 bucket (be sure to add your bucket name)._
2. _Then upload your index.html file (which happens to be in a folder called main) into the bucket._

* Click on **commit** to save the workflow, this will trigger Actions to begin.

## Run your Pipeline

Navigate to Actions to see your pipeline in action.

At the end of a successful build, it should look like this:

Check your S3 bucket and you should see your deployed site.
