# How to public

## S3 Bucket

To public our website, we wil be using AWS S3 Bucket service. To configure it, the steps are as follows:

### Step 1. Creating S3 Bucket

* Go to **S3** and click **Create bucket**.

* Select a region. I recommend the American ones because they are the cheapest, but decide for yourself based on your needs. 
* Give the bucket a name.
* Scroll down and uncheck **Block all public access**. So that we can host our public static website.

* Scroll to the bottom and press **Create bucket**.

### Step 2. Pre-settings for the static website

* In the list of buckets, select the created bucket and go to **Properties** tab.

* Scroll all the way down and find **Static website hosting** section. Click on **Edit**.

* Change the setting to **Enable**, enter the index document name and **Save changes**.

### Step 3. Adding a bucket policy

To make the objects in the bucket publicly readable, we must write a bucket policy that grants everyone `s3:GetObject` permission.

* Scroll up and find **Bucket Policy**. Choose **Edit**
* To grant public read access for your website, copy the following bucket policy, and paste it in the **Bucket policy editor**.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::Bucket-Name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

5. Update the `Resource` to your bucket name. In the preceding example bucket policy, `Bucket-Name` is a placeholder for the bucket name. 
6. Choose **Save changes**. A message appears indicating that the bucket policy has been successfully added.

## Creating IAM User

Now what we need to do is to create a new **IAM** user. This user will give controll access to the S3 bucket. We need this user's credentials for our pipeline.

* Navigate to **IAM** and from the menu on the left, click on **Users**.
* Choose **Create User** to create a new user.

* Give your user a name (e.g. _devopsuser_).

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simplesite/assets/49815002/6646f2bf-6c64-4559-bc33-e62cdc53721a)

* Click **Next**. Select **Attach policies directly**. From the provided list, select **AmazonS3FullAccess** (_this gives devopsuser full access to S3 bucket_).

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simplesite/assets/49815002/72a9a799-fc43-4421-8d53-450b246fc2f1)

* Go **Next**. There you can add a tag and review your user. Then hit **Create user**.

## Ð¡reating access key

* We need to create an access key to send programmatic calls to AWS. Select the user in the user list and proceed to **Security credentials tab** and click **Create access key**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simplesite/assets/49815002/9f6adc75-f2a0-483d-9660-8881242a3f0f)

* Select **Command Line Interface (CLI)**

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simplesite/assets/49815002/cb28e337-355c-46c4-995b-2e969111be21)

* You can add a description to recognize your key later. After that hit **Create access key**. 

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simplesite/assets/49815002/bf02c881-87ab-4cd4-8eca-02dad0ed7464)

* Once the process is complete, you will be able to download your user credentials. **Remember to keep it private**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simplesite/assets/49815002/b4817352-98f3-4458-92ee-9def87e6f011)

## Passing the credentials to github

Now that we have created the user, we need to use the credentials in our github account.

* In the github repository click on **Settings**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simplesite/assets/49815002/f1420b0f-798f-4b3f-bc8e-df910ea96dbc)

* From the left hand menu, scroll down to **Security** and click on **Secrets and variables**, When the dropdown opens, select **Actions**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simplesite/assets/49815002/441bb366-7e3b-4e7f-b1e3-3f3649e46fe5)

* Now we are going to add our user credentials to this repository. Click on **New repository** secret and add your **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**. Repeat the action for **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simplesite/assets/49815002/223ede74-befb-4230-b0f2-88f82da01d09)

We are doing this because it is best practice to not expose your security keys to the public. 

## Creating a Workflow

Next, we create a _workflow_ for the deployment.

* Select the **Actions** tab.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simplesite/assets/49815002/d5cf8d7b-5a31-4808-a03c-03f5809835f0)

* Click on **New workflow**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simplesite/assets/49815002/f5505b73-bc61-4304-8b8a-c54e3d87dd4e)

* Click on **set up workflow yourself**.

![image](https://github.com/Joer4765/simplesite/assets/49815002/194e4a47-53df-4cd2-8e25-e63d792c8ceb)

* Next, insert this script into your workspace.

```yaml
name: Upload Website

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main

jobs:
  deploy-site:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@master
        with:
          args: --delete
        env:
          AWS_S3_BUCKET: YOUR BUCKET NAME
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          SOURCE_DIR: ./main
```

_This workflow says that once you push your code to the main branch the following tasks should take place one after the other:_

1. _GitHub Actions will search for the credentials you stored in secrets and use that to access your S3 bucket (be sure to add your bucket name)._
2. _Then upload your index.html file (which happens to be in a folder called main) into the bucket._

* Click on **commit** to save the workflow, this will trigger Actions to begin.

## Run your Pipeline

Navigate to Actions to see your pipeline in action.

At the end of a successful build, it should look like this:

Check your S3 bucket and you should see your deployed site.
